# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

**Import & Visualize the Data**

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Added popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context map data.
